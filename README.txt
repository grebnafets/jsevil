This is a simple a goofy toy project that does "bad" things* but is still so
cheese that I can't bring my self to do the right thing and drop it.

Origionally I just wanted to be able to develop random stuff in javaScript
in a terminal. I didn't know the developers of Node.js have already developed
everything I wanted so jsevil is now basically just a wrapper around it.

If you find anything you like, take it.  Unless it is me you actually like.
Then you can't just take me, I am a living thing you know. I am also a burden,
I eat alot of pizza, drink lot of coffee and then I wabble in circles thinking
out loud in binary. I am also a dude and I grow beard for one whole month and
then I shave it off. And _NO_, I am _not_ a mascot!

Anyway, if you are a bad boy/girl and clone jsevil, then don't forget to
define the environment variable JSEVIL_SEARCH_PATH so it
points to the downloaded jsevil directory.
You are of course going need node.js if you want to be able to do the good
stuff and do http request. (U need xmlhttprequest module).
You also need C and GO language compiler and python interpreter...

Anyway, have fun!
May the force be with you! Fly Penguin fly!

*Bad as in not using any standards, using macroes and so on.
