JSEvil is for next generation of developers who have learned many spells from
many different languages. They don't give a duck anymore and frequently ride
on Penguins. These hardened soles know that the idiomatic way is the path of
DOOM. Not wanting to suffer from stockholm syndrom due to over use of
exclusive-anti-social part of a language, they use the inclusive set of all
languages that they hate equally! They are bent to wabble into glory!

May the force be with you! Fly Penguin fly!

Oh, I almost forgot.

JSEvil is a simple framework that is uses environment variables, makefiles,
preprocessors and scripts so you can do more without the usual limitations that
follows overdose of "abstractions".

Right now it has:

sprintf:
It takes in fmt,... and returns the formatted string.

printf:
Same as sprintf but it outputs the formmated string to the terminal or
delegates the responsibility to console.log if it is defined.

test:
Test is actually a macro. Yes, you read right. You didn't expect less from
jsEVIL, now did you? I did use "eval" at first, abstracted as "evil" within
a variable. Then I thought it was not evil enough and thought it was lame to
evaluate string to code so I reversed it to evaluate code to string via macro.
Yeah, I know. Me crafty stupid spankey monkey bastard.

My only regred is the fact I don't have the goto statement...
..Yet :) *evil laughter*
