Integration will diff two output files together.

showSet.py will show you what is expected.
showUnset.py will show you what the result is.
set.py will set result to expected.
test.py will compare what is expected to result.

How to use:
	python [scriptname.py] [modulename1, modulename2 ...]

Example:
	python showSet.py printf calendar

You can also skip the argument and it will check all known modulenames.
